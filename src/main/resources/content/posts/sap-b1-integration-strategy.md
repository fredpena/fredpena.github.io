SAP Business One integrations demand clarity and resilience. A good strategy reduces risk and keeps systems consistent.

## Service Layer vs DI API
Choose based on workload, latency tolerance, and operational constraints. Use each where it fits best.

## Patterns
Normalize payloads, isolate business rules, and build retries with observability in mind.

## Outcome
Stable data flows and integrations that survive real-world complexity.
