Communities are the long game. When built with intention, they become a force multiplier for talent and innovation.

## Start with clarity
Define the mission, the audience, and the value you want to deliver.

## Build a cadence
Regular meetups, consistent content, and clear paths for new contributors create momentum.

## Outcome
A self-sustaining community that elevates the entire ecosystem.
