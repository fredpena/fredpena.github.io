Modern Java teams win with predictable pipelines. The goal is fast feedback without compromising quality.

## Build discipline
Cache dependencies, standardize build steps, and treat the pipeline as a product.

## Release safety
Use progressive delivery, automated checks, and clear rollback strategies.

## Outcome
Teams release with confidence and keep velocity high.
