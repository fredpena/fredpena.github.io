Modernization works best when it is incremental. You can move fast without breaking what already works.

## Assessment
Start with a dependency map, then define the smallest modern slice that delivers value.

## Execution
Split modules, move to modern runtimes, and invest in testing along the way.

## Outcome
Less risk, better performance, and a platform ready for the next decade.
