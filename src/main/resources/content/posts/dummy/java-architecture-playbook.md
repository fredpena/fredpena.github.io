Scaling a Java platform is less about tools and more about consistent decisions. This playbook collects the architecture moves that keep teams aligned.

## Principles
Start with clarity: service boundaries, data contracts, and ownership. Then design for resilience and safe change.

## Reviews
Architecture reviews should be lightweight but frequent. Use them to keep standards real, not theoretical.

## Outcome
Fewer surprises, faster delivery, and systems that keep improving over time.
