Cloud-native Java is not just about containers. It is about operational clarity, fast feedback loops, and a platform that scales with confidence.

## Design goals
Start with reliability, then optimize for speed. Define SLOs early, and use them to drive architectural decisions.

## Platform primitives
Choose a small set of primitives that teams can reuse: service templates, health endpoints, logging conventions, and deployment pipelines.

## Outcome
Teams ship faster because they do not reinvent the foundation every time. Consistency becomes leverage.
