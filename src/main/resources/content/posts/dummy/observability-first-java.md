Observability is a design decision, not an afterthought. It should be part of the definition of done.

## Signals that matter
Logs, metrics, and traces are only useful when they connect to a clear operational question.

## Practical defaults
Adopt standard logging fields, consistent metrics naming, and trace propagation across every boundary.

## Outcome
Faster incident response and more confident releases.
