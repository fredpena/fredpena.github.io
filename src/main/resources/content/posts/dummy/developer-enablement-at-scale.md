Developer enablement is a product. When treated as such, it changes the way teams plan, prioritize, and measure success.

## The biggest blockers
Slow feedback, inconsistent tooling, and unclear standards. Fix these first to unlock speed and quality.

## A simple playbook
Provide golden paths, reduce decision fatigue, and invest in internal documentation that answers questions before they are asked.

## Outcome
Teams spend more time delivering value and less time fighting the platform.
