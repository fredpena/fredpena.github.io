Vaadin Flow is a productivity multiplier when paired with strong UI standards and a consistent design system.

## Platform approach
Standardize components, define accessibility rules, and create UI templates teams can reuse.

## Delivery
Keep the UI close to backend logic, but isolated enough to evolve safely.

## Outcome
Faster delivery without sacrificing quality or security.
